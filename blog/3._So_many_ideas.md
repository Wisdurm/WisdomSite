# Egad!

It's happened again. For the first time in quite a while, I've reached a point
in my life, where I have more ideas than time. I know for some it might seem
strange **not** to feel this way, but for quite a while I've been very complacent
and very "happy" to just work on Runtime. Recently though, that's not been the
case. I've been working on a roguelike about peeling potatoes, which I really
hope to finish. I'm trying to keep the scope realistic so I don't spend months
only to lose motivation, just like with Horrible World, the tower defense game,
Terrabit, and all the other projects that I didn't even get to spend months on
(though to be fair, many of those did have other valid reasons).  

But disregarding gamedev, I've also had a lot of other ideas, such as revamping
this site to not look to incredibly ugly, and finish some features (such as the
incomplete project list, and the contact forum that
I-will-totally-do-at-some-point-I-promise). Runtime is also something I've thought
a lot about. Apart from finishing 0.11 and refactoring the codebase and improving
documentation and the system for it and benchmarking and speeding it up and reducing
code and adding more features and making it less dreadful to use, I've also wanted
to make it easily embeddable. I've already got ideas to "utilize" Runtime:
* A simple game engine with Runtime as the scripting language
* A text editor with Runtime as the extension/configuration language  

So many ideas... Usually this could be kinda dreadful (and I am already afraid of
losing sight of some things I **am** working on), but considering my lackluster
work in past year or so, its also kinda nice. Runtime is the only project I've
really managed to do anything with so far, and even then I've been so lazy that
its still very unfinished. Blah blah, who gives a shit.

# Blog thoughts

I'm hoping to start writing stuff here more, maybe even some personal stuff (like
this one was). I don't suddenly believe people are interested in my thoughts or
anything, but I've grown to admire people who just do things. I'm hoping to be
less of a coward and start putting up lots of more interesting stuff on this site,
especially after I redesign it.

Maybe one day I can look back on all the stuff here and think that at least I
haven't completely wasted my life.
