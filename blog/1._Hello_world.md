# Hello world!

Welcome to my first blog post! I know, quite amazing isn't it, especially because it took 3 days to get working...  
But hey! I've been short on time, and its not like I just used Wordpress or something.  
Now I'll just quickly talk about this ordeal, and while I'm at it, test out some markdown features.

## Markdown parsing in C++

Surprise surpise, doing something like this does come with its hurdles.  

First of all, installing libraries in C++ is still quite a nightmare. Even with all of the tools modern soy-beta devs like I have
at my exposal (CMake, Vcpkg, CPMCMake, etc...), it can still be quite annoying to download a library and manage to get it to link
to your project.  

The way I went about this project was:

1. ### Download the source code for MD4C, and get it to link to my code  

	This proved very annoying, since I had to manually try to get CMake to link some subdirectories or something, I don't really remember,
point is I couldn't figure it out. 

2. ### Build my own markdown parser  

	At first this was an attractive option, but soon after starting I realized I've already built two parsers within the last few months,
and both of those both took time, and made me want to pull my hair out, so I figured that I might as well just get this done quick.

3. ### Cpp-Markdown

	I found this markdown library that hasn't been updated in over 10 years, but I figured if it supported the basic functions you would
except from markdown, it would be good enough.  
I couldn't manage to get Boost::Regex to link to my project :sigh:

4. ### MD4C... again

	This time, I realized md4c was on vcpkg, and after that this whole thing turned out quite easy in the end. Vcpkg is such an easy to use
and overall great tool that I can't help but love it, even if it is built by Microsoft.  
The actual workings of md4c were a bit counterintuitive, but in the end it only took like 10-15 minutes of pondering to get it to work.

	```
	// This is very bizarre
	std::string result = "";
	md_html(markdown.c_str(),
		MD_SIZE(markdown.size()),
		captureHtmlFragment,
		&result,
		NULL,
		NULL
	);
	return result;
	```

## End

I don't really have much to write about here, and this post overall was quite hastily thrown together, but the main point was just to
test whether or not this all works anyways, so its not a big deal.
